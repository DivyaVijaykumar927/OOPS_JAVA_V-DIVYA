OOPS_JAVA_V DIVYA
 OOPS in Java – Coursework Repository
Welcome to my Object-Oriented Programming using Java (OOPS) coursework repository!
This project is part of my academic curriculum and contains basic Java programs that demonstrate key OOP principles. All programs were written and executed using Notepad and Command Prompt (CMD) — showing that you don’t need a full-fledged IDE to get started with Java.

📚 What's Inside
This repository includes .java source files that illustrate foundational OOP concepts through beginner-friendly examples:

✅ Classes and Objects

✅ Constructors

✅ Inheritance

✅ Polymorphism

✅ Abstraction and Interfaces

✅ Encapsulation

✅ Method Overloading and Overriding

Each concept is demonstrated with simple and concise code examples to make learning easier.

💻 How to Compile and Run Java Code (Using Notepad + CMD)
You don’t need tools like Eclipse or IntelliJ to run Java programs. Just follow these manual steps:

📝 Step 1: Write Java Code in Notepad
Open Notepad.

Copy any Java code from this repository.

Save the file with a .java extension.
Example: InheritanceDemo.java

⚠️ Make sure the filename matches the public class name inside the file.

When saving, choose "All Files" under Save as type, and ensure the file ends with .java.

💻 Step 2: Open Command Prompt (CMD)
Press Windows + R, type cmd, and press Enter.

Navigate to the directory where your .java file is located:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd "C:\Users\YourName\Desktop"
🛠️ Step 3: Compile the Java File
Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and its bin directory added to your system's PATH.

To compile your code, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
javac YourFileName.java
Replace YourFileName.java with the actual name of your file.

If there are no syntax errors, this will generate a corresponding .class file.

🚀 Step 4: Run the Compiled Program
Now run your compiled program using:

bash
Copy
Edit
java YourFileName
Again, exclude the .java extension while running.
